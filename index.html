<h4 class = "text-left">Part 1: Modifying the Blink Sketch</h4>
<ul class = "list-unstyled">
<li>For this part of the lab, we made simple modifications to the preexisting code in order to work for an external LED. We declared a global variable `pin` in order to specify the external pin we wish to have blink.</li><br> 

<h4 class = "text-left"> Part 2: Outputing Analog Voltages</h4>

<li>For the second phase of the lab, we took advantage of the `analogRead` method in order to use the analog voltage values that were being controlled by the potentiometer. Here's our code:</li><br>
<code>
int sensorPin = A0;<br>
int voltageValue = 0;<br>
int delayTime = 500;<br> <br>

void setup() {<br>
  <ul>Serial.begin(9600);</ul>
}<br><br>

void loop() {<br>
  <ul>voltageValue = analogRead(sensorPin);<br>
  Serial.println(voltageValue);<br>
  delay(delayTime);</ul>
}
</code> <br>

<li>Here's a photo of the circuit:</li> <br>
<img class="img-fluid img-centered" src="./resources/6d352b7943044248b06bf93e79163291.jpeg" alt="">

<h4 class = "text-left">Part 3: Analog LED Output</h4>

<li>The third phase of this lab is very similar to the previous part. We used the `analogWrite` function in order to write analog PWM voltages to the LED. We mapped the input voltage to the output voltage written to the LED using the following mapping scheme. The maximum value (unknown units) for the voltage we were getting was 1023; the minimum value was 6. The maximum allowed input for analogWrite is 255, so we essentially made the analog output vary linearly between 0 and 255 for all allowed analog inputs from the potentiometer. For reference, the code has been included below:</li> <br>

<code>
int sensorPin = A0;<br>
int outputPin = 11;<br>
float voltageValue = 0;<br><br>


void setup() {<br>
  <ul>pinMode(outputPin, OUTPUT);<br>
  Serial.begin(9600);</ul>
}<br><br>

void loop() {<br>
  <ul>voltageValue = analogRead(sensorPin);<br>
  analogWrite(outputPin, 255 * (voltageValue-6)/1017);<br>
  Serial.println(voltageValue);<br>
  //Frequency of PWM is 490.2 Hz</ul>
}
</code> <br>

<h4 class = "text-left"> Part 4: Parallax Servos </h4>

<li>For the final lab component, we actuated the angular velocity of the servos using the voltage read by the Arduino (controlled by series resistor and potentiometer). We utilized a similar mapping scheme as the previous part, except with different scaling to accomodate for the servo `write` function input. The Arduino code has been included below:</li> <br>

<code>
#include <Servo.h>; <br>
Servo servo;<br>
int outputPin = 11;<br>
int sensorPin = A0;<br>
float voltageValue;<<br><br>

void setup() {<br>
  <ul>// put your setup code here, to run once:<3>
  Serial.begin(9600);<br>
  pinMode(outputPin, OUTPUT);<br>
  servo.attach(outputPin);</ul>
}<br><br>

void loop() {<br>
  <ul>// put your main code here, to run repeatedly:<br>
  voltageValue = analogRead(sensorPin);<br>
  float servoSpeed = 180 * (voltageValue-1)/989;<br>
  Serial.println(servoSpeed);<br>
  servo.write(servoSpeed);</ul>
}</code> <br>

```

<h4 class = "text-left"> Progress on Robot:</h4>

<li>This week we also began working on the basic functionality of the robot. We used what we learned in Lab 1 to implement robot movement. </li><br>

<li>We first built the robot chassis using the 3D-printed and laser-etched parts already sitting in the lab room. We used:</li>
  <ul>
<li>1 robot base (the large red platform in the image)</li>
<li> 2 servo mounts</li>
<li>2 continuous rotation servos</li>
<li> 2 wheels</li>
<li>2 rubber bands</li>
<li>1 Arduino Uno</li>
<li>1 battery holder (with 2 AA batteries)</li>
<li> 1 breadboard</li>
<li>Various wires, screws, nuts, and spacers</li>
</ul><br>

<li>The construction of the robot was a fairly simple, but time-consuming process. We modeled our prototype off of the existing robots sitting in the lab room. The Arduino sits on the top of the robot, and the servo mounts (and the accompanying servo-wheel pieces) sit below. See the images for more details. </li><br>
<img class="img-fluid img-centered" src="./resources/lab1robot1.jpg" alt=""> <br>
<img class="img-fluid img-centered" src="./resources/lab1robot2.jpg" alt=""> <br>

<li>Our power setup was somewhat less than ideal. Because the standard 5V battery packs were discharged (and according to the TAs, took a significant amount of time to charge), we relied on a battery holder with 2 AA batteries inside to power our servos. Because the batteries could not sit on the robot, we used a breadboard to wire up the servo power lines (as well as the servo control lines). We also used the standard Arduino power supply cable to power the Arduino. The wiring was a bit messy, and the breadboard sat apart from the robot. This meant that when we actually made the servos move, we had to be very careful. Cleaning up the wiring (perhaps by using a protoboard) is a priority for us.</li> <br>

<li>Once the robot was set up, we modified the code from Part 4 of the lab to control 2 servos. We programmed the servos to move in the same direction, so the robot spun in a little circle! This occurred because the servos are oriented in opposite directions on the actual robot chassis. Once we realized this error, we modified the code so that one servo was rotating in the opposite direction of the other. The arduino code has been included below:</li><br>

<code>
#include <Servo.h><br>
Servo servo1;<br>
Servo servo2;<br><br>
 
// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board<br>
void setup() {<br>
  <ul>Serial.begin(9600);<br>
  servo1.attach(9);<br>
  servo2.attach(11);</ul>
}<br><br>
 
// the loop function runs over and over again forever<br>
void loop() {<br>
  <ul>servo1.write(0);<br>
  servo2.write(180);<br>
  delay(5000);</ul>
}
</code> <br><br>
<li>Since the arduino was still being powered by a cable to our computer, we couldn't get a vide of the robot moving autonomously. We could see the wheels of the robot moving as expected, but the arduino power cable prevented the robot from traveling too far from the laptop we were using. We hope to improve on this setup and record a cool video of our robot next time!</li><br>

<h4 class = "text-center">Optical Team -- IR Circuit</h4>
<p class = "text-center">Evan, Radhika and Michael</p>
<ul class = "list-unstyled">


<li>Materials used:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>breadboard</li>
    <li>wires</li>
    <li>phototransistor</li>
    <li>resistors</li>
    <li>capacitor</li>

    <li>oscilloscope</li>
    <li>LM358 operational amplifier</li>
    <li>treasure</li>
  </ul> <br>

<li>For this component of the lab, we constructed a circuit that is able to detect electromagnetic radiation of infrared (IR) frequncy. A photo transistor was used to modulate the circuit in response to a 7 kHz pulsating IR light. The phototransistor works via an embedded bipolar junction transistor, which is able to pass current in response to incident electromagnetic radiation. The changing current causes voltage to drop across the serial resistor. We measured the voltage at the terminal of the resistor with an oscilloscope. The amplitude of the voltage recorded was around 100 mV. This voltage was directly connected to an analog pin of the Arduino Uno with a wire.</li><br>

<li>Below is a photograph of the oscilloscope depicting the sinusoidal voltage signal generated from the phototransistor. </li> <br>

<img class="img-fluid img-centered" src="./resources/lab2irscope.jpg" alt="">

<li>We've also included a photo of the circuit:</li> <br>

<img class="img-fluid img-centered" src="./resources/lab2ircircuit.jpg" alt="">

<li>We then used the standard `fft` library to process the voltage signal. The Arduino has built-in hardware capable of processing the signal using the ADC (analog-to-digital) converter, which performs better than the regular `analogRead` function for high frequency data.</li> <br>

<li>The data was then transformed into the frequency-domain using the `fft` library. FFT--or Fast Fourier Transform--is a method used by computers to efficiently convert time-domain data into the frequency domain. We utilized the `fft_adc_serial` script to output a serial stream of frequency data. The `fft` takes advantage of the analog-to-digital converter. Each serial line of output corresponds to the amplitude of the input signal at a frequency related to the relative index of the line output. Each index corresponds to an integer multiple of the bin frequency width, so index <em>i</em> corresponds to frequency <em>f<sub>w</sub>i</em>, where <em>f<sub>w</sub></em> is the bin frequency width. </li> <br>

<li>In order to make sense of the FFT data, we needed to figure out the bin frequency width. Using the data sheet, we deduced that the bin frequency width, <em>f<sub>w</sub></em>, is roughly 150 Hz. </li> <br>

<li>After gathering the FFT serial data, we plotted the data in MATLAB. Included below is a MATLAB plot we generated from the data:</li> <br>

<img class="img-fluid img-centered" src="./resources/fftir.png" alt="">

<li>Since the bin width is 150 Hz, and the pulsating frequency of the IR signal is  7 kHz, we should see high ampilitude around bin index 46. The MATLAB plot clearly shows this feature at around that index value, demonstrating that the Arduino can detect IR signals.</li><br>

<li>Our intelligent physical system will need to perform some action upon detecting the 7 kHz signal (in addition to other IR frequencies). An additional challenge is that this 7 kHz signal will likely have a low intensity due to the distance at which it is being transmitted to the phototransistor. To remedy these problems, we had to implement an analog circuit along with a high pass filter, in addition to writing scripts in Arduino that would perform some action upon detecting the desired IR frequency. </li> <br>

<li> The raw voltage signal being transmitted from the phototransistor is roughly ~100 mV peak-to-peak with some DC voltage, but this AC swing can be much lower depending on the treasure distance. In order to ensure that the voltage reading at the Arduino is detectable/high enough, we created a non-inverting operational amplifier (op-amp) with the LM358 amplifier. </li> <br>


<li>Since the raw output from the phototransistor had a non-trivial DC component, any gain would amplify the total voltage well beyond the rail voltage (5V) of the amplifier, creating an unusable signal. To mitigate this issue, we created a simple high-pass filter using a capacitor and a resistor to filter out low frequency (DC) signals. The lowest frequency capable of passing through the high-pass filter (commonly referred to as the cutoff frequency) is equal to the equation below:</li> <br>

<img class="img-fluid img-centered" src="./resources/cutoff_frequency.png" alt="">

<li>We selected an arbitrary capacitor and then calibrated the resistance of the resistor such that most low-frequency (DC) signals would be eliminated. Below is the circuit schematic:</li> <br>

<img class="img-fluid img-centered" src="./resources/fullcircuitschematic.png" alt="">


<li>Below is a photo of the full circuit:</li> <br>

<img class="img-fluid img-centered" src="./resources/ircircuit.JPG" alt="">


<li>Here are the values of the components we used:</li> 
  <ul>

    <li>R3 = 9.7 kΩ</li>
    <li>R4 = 47.9 kΩ</li>
    <li>R2 = 8 kΩ</li>
    <li>R1 = 1.78 kΩ </li>
    <li>C1 = 3.3 nF</li>
  </ul> <br>

<li>The gain of our amplifier was roughly 6 (Av= 1 + R4/R3) . That is, our input voltage would be multiplied by a factor of 6 at the output of the amplifier. </li>

<li>Here is the oscilloscope reading of the input voltage and output (amplified) voltage:</li>

<img class="img-fluid img-centered" src="./resources/rotatedirscope.JPG" alt="">

<li>The final step was to have the Arduino perform some action in response to detecting the frequency. </li> <br>

<li>To do this, we added `if` statements to the standard `fft_adc_serial` script that would read the amplitude from the FFT bin corresponding to 7 kHz frequency and then do a `digitalWrite` command:</li>

<br>
<code>
  if (fft_log_out[47]>75){ <br>
      <ul>digitalWrite(13, HIGH); </ul>
  } <br>
  else if (fft_log_out[47]<75){ <br>
      <ul>digitalWrite(13, LOW); </ul>
  }
</code>
<br><br>

<li>Pin 13 corresponds to an led output on the Arduino Uno. Below is a video of the Arduino Uno illuminating pin 13 in response to the 7 kHz signal. Note that the pin illuminates when the treasure is brought within ~6 in. of the transistor, but turns off once it is out of range. </li> <br>

<li>We will need to modify the circuit to include a band pass filter in order to better detect multiple discrete frequencies (multiple treasures). </li><br>

<li>Materials used:</li>
  <ul> 
    <li>Electret microphone</li>

    <li>300 Ohm resistors</li>
    <li>3k Ohm resistor</li>

    <li>tone generating application</li>
  </ul><br>
<li>In this part of the lab, we built a microphone circuit and wrote code so that our Arduino would be able to detect a tone of 660 Hz, the frequency that signals the robot to start navigating the maze.</li><br>
 
<h5 class = "text-left">Testing:</h5>

<li>Before we got to lab, we went onto the Open Music Lab’s website and downloaded the FFT library.  We needed a Fast Fourier Transform algorithm to detect specific frequencies using a microphone. A Fourier transform decomposes a signal into the frequencies that make it up. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is a way to compute a Fourier transform in O(n log(n)) time instead of O(n^2) time, by recursively breaking down a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) into much smaller DFTs.</li> <br>

<li>Fast Fourier Transform essentially performs a discrete time fourier transform (DTFT) in a time-efficient manner. The formula for DTFT is:</li> <br>

<img class="img-fluid img-centered" src="./resources/FT_algorithm.svg" alt="">

<li><em>x<sub>n</sub></em> is the value at index <em>n</em> of the array containing time-domain data (of length N), and <em>X<sub>k</sub></em>< is the value at index <em>k</em> of the frequency-domain data. The complex valued frequency domain data encodes both the phase and amplitude of the constituent signal at a specific frequency. </li> <br>

<li>We opened the example script from the FFT library named fft_adc_serial, and tested the code using an oscilloscope and function generator with parameters of 660 Hz, 3.3V/2 Vpp, and a 0.825V offset.  We then recorded the data using the Arduino’s Serial Monitor, and plotted the results using excel.  Graphs from two subsequent trials are shown below: </li> <br>

<img class="img-fluid img-centered" src="./resources/lab2_acoustic_data1.png" alt="">


<img class="img-fluid img-centered" src="./resources/lab2_acoustic_data2.png" alt="">


<li>Our peak voltage for every trial we ran occurred at the 5th data point or "bin".</li> <br>

<li>To compute the frequency width of each bin, we consulted the ADC section of the ATmega328 datasheet. We found that the last 3 bits of the ADC Control and Status Register (ADCSRA) determines the division factor between the system clock frequency and the input clock to the ADC. In the fft_adc_serial code, ADCSRA was written 0xe5, making the division factor = 32.</li> <br>

<li>Thus, we calculated the sampling frequency:</li><br>

<li>ADC sampling frequency = 16 MHz (system clock frequency) / 32 (division factor) / 13 (conversion time) = 38 kHz</li><br>

<li>Finally, the bin frequency width was calculated as follows:</li><br>

<li>Bin width = 38 kHz (sampling frequency) / 256 samples = 150 Hz / sample</li><br>

<li>Therefore, bin 5 contains the range of frequencies 600 - 750 Hz, which matches our data.</li><br>


<h5 class = "text-left">Building the circuit:</h5>

<li>After we got this initial data, we started building our microphone circuit.  The figure below shows the schematic of the circuit we went off from the course website.</li> <br>
<img class="img-fluid img-centered" src="./resources/lab2_acoustic_data3.png" alt="">


<li>And here's what our microphone circuit looked like: </li><br>
<img class="img-fluid img-centered" src="./resources/lab2_acoustic_data4.png" alt="">

<li>Once we built the circuit, we checked to see if it was working as expected.  We found a free online tone generator as shown below.  We then played the tone off a computer next to the circuit and observed the results using an oscilloscope. Our general set-up can be seen in this video below: </li> <br>
<video width="460" height="270" controls preload> 
    <source src="resources/IMG_0196.mp4"></source> 
</video>

<li>The oscilloscope showed that it was taking in data from the acoustics in the room, and generating a wave of frequency 660 Hz when the tone was played next to the circuit, as shown in the photo of the oscilloscope screen below.</li><br>
<img class="img-fluid img-centered" src="./resources/lab2_acoustic_data5.png" alt="">


<li>From there, we fed the microphone output to the Arduino, and in the loop function we checked for a peak in bin 5.</li><br>
<code>
//detects input on bin 5 and performs start function<br>
if (fft_log_out[4] > 120) {<br>
  <ul>start();</ul>
}
</code> <br>

<li>To visually demonstrate the Arduino's ability to detect the start signal, we had it light up an LED once the microphone detected it. We created a start function which would typically begin line detection, make the robot's wheels subsequently turn, and so on. </li> <br>

<code>
//This function will "start" the robot and perform any functions necessary <br>
for operation. Right now it turns on an LED. <br>
// <br>
void start() {<br>
  <ul>digitalWrite(13, HIGH);</ul>
}
</code> <br>

<li>Below is a video of the arduino LED responding to a 660 Hz signal: </li>
<video width="460" height="270" controls preload> 
    <source src="resources/IMG_0198.mp4"></source> 
</video>


<h5 class = "text-left"> Distinguishing between 585 Hz and 735 Hz:</h5>

<li>Now that the Arduino could detect a 660 Hz tone, we wanted to determine if it could distinguish between a 585 Hz and 735 Hz tone. We set the oscilloscope to these frequencies and took the FFT using the previous fft_adc_serial code. However, there was an immediate issue -- 585 Hz and 660 Hz were both in bin 5:</li><br>
<img class="img-fluid img-centered" src="./resources/FFT32" alt="">


<li>In order to fix this issue, we had to decrease the bin size by changing the division factor. To do this, we changed the last 3 bits of ADCSRA to 111. This corresponds to a division factor of 128. Now, the three tones were located in distinct bins.</li><br>
<img class="img-fluid img-centered" src="./resources/FFT128.png" alt="">

<li>Using our previous equation with the new prescaler, we calculated the bin width to be 37.5 Hz and 660 Hz to be located in the 17th bin. However, the 660 Hz tone was repeatedly located in bin 19. We weren't able to determine the cause of this discrepancy. In any case, we updated the code to detect for a peak in bin 19.</li><br>
<code>
//detects input on bin 19 and performs start function<br>
if (fft_log_out[4] > 120) {<br>
  start();<br>
}
</code><br>

<li>Since the oscilloscope input worked, we also wanted to try an audio input. We played the 585 Hz tone, then the 735 Hz tone, and finally the 660 Hz tone which causes the LED to light up:</li><br>
<video width="460" height="270" controls preload> 
    <source src="resources/lab2_tones.mov"></source> 
</video> <br> <br>

<h5 class = "text-left">Amplifier Circuit</h5>

<li>We realize that in the future, the tone may not be as loud as it was when it was played off a computer, and so we started building a simple Non-inverting Op Amp circuit to amplify the signal from the microphone.  The schematic we were going off is shown in a picture below: </li><br>
<img class="img-fluid img-centered" src="./resources/lab2_acoustic_data6.png" alt="">

<li>http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/opamp/opamp15.gif</li> <br>

<li>We did not implement this amplifier in this part of the lab, but we have built the amplifier and are ready to use it if we discover that it becomes necessary down the line. </li>   <br>

                  <h5 class ='text-left' >FPGA-VGA Interface</h5> </li><br>

                  <li>The adapter that connects the FPGA output to the VPA cable is a DAC converter. A DAC converter converts a digital input to an analog output. In other words, the FGPA encodes the 3-channel colors as multi-bit digital binary values, and then the adapter converts these multi-bit values into 1 continuous voltage value. In our case, the VGA supports a maximum 1v input for each color channel. Therefore, the voltage value for each channel is computed by converting the 2-3 bit values (with 3.3v for each `HIGH` bit) for each color channel into 1 analog voltage that can be between 0v and 1v. </li><br>

<li>Below is a circuit diagram of the DAC:</li><br>
<img class="img-fluid img-centered" src="./resources/dacconverter.png" alt=""> <br>


<li>One can solve for the voltage at the `Red` node (`Vred`). Vred = 0.141*R[2] + 0.0684*R[1] + 0.0321*R[0]. Notice that the "weights" for each bit vary by powers of two, with the MSB having twice the weight as the 1st bit, and the 0th (LSB) bit having 1/4 of the weight as a MSB. In order words, the converter is adding up the bits and weighting each one accordingly in order to generate 1 final voltage value. The bins are also weighted such that if all bits (R[2], R[1], and R[0]) are pulled high (3.3v), the voltage at the output can be supported by the monitor (it comes out to ~0.8v).<li><br>

<li>A similar analysis yields the analog voltage at the `Green` node. </li><br>

<li>For the blue node, the voltage `Vblue` comes out to be: Vblue = 0.1456*B[1] + 0.07096*B[0]. Notice that the weight for B[1] is twice that of B[0] in order to ensure that the analog voltage represents the digital value. </li><br>

<li>Another way to think about this converter is by noticing that the resistor values for bits that are weighted more strongly are lower (in fact, the resistor values vary by powers of 2 in order to correspond to voltage weightings of powers of 2). The low-impedance connection between significant bits and the output ensures that this bit will have more influence over the voltage at the output node than bits that are seperated by large resistors. </li><br>

<li>The color (red, green, blue) intensity for any given pixel will be proportional to the analog voltage value for that given color channel. So if all the bits for a given channel are `HIGH`, the analog voltage will be at its highest, and the intensity of that color will be maximized.  </li><br>


<li><h5 class = "text-left">Part 1: Coloring the entire screen</h5><br>

<li>For the first part of this lab, we simply wanted to write the same color value to each pixel on the display. For this, we needed a simple `assign` statement (i.e. `assign PIXEL_COLOR = 8'd300`). </li><br>

<li> <h5 class ='text-left' >Part 2: Coloring a grid</h5></li><br>

<li>For the second part of the lab, we wanted to have the FPGA write a colored 2x2 grid to the display. We divided this task into two part: a) mapping the raw pixel coordinates to a quadrant on the 2x2 grid, and b) given a quadrant, output what the color should be. </li><br>

<li>In order to compute what quadrant of the 2x2 (or outside the grid) a given pixel location corresponded to, we created a new module called `GRID_SELECTOR`. Essentially, `GRID_SELECTOR` divides the pixel coordinates by 128 in order to calculate the grid location. We achieve this division by using a bitshift. We also made the grid width a power of 2 in order to enable us to use this grid assignment method. We made it so that all pixels which fall outside the grid are given a value of 2 for the grid index. Below is our code for this module:</li><br>

<code>
module GRID_SELECTOR(<br>
CLOCK_50,<br>
PIXEL_COORD_X,<br>
PIXEL_COORD_Y,<br>
GRID_X,<br>
GRID_Y);<br><br>


input CLOCK_50;<br>
input wire [9:0] PIXEL_COORD_X;<br>
input wire [9:0] PIXEL_COORD_Y;<br>
output reg [3:0] GRID_X;<br>
output reg [3:0] GRID_Y;<br><br>




always @ (*) begin<br>
 <ul> GRID_X = PIXEL_COORD_X >>>7;<br>
  GRID_Y = PIXEL_COORD_Y >>>7<br>
  if (GRID_X>4'd1) begin<br>
    <ul>GRID_X = 4'd2;</ul>
  end<br>
  if (GRID_Y>4'd1) begin<br>
    <ul>GRID_Y = 4'd2;</ul>
  end</ul>
end<br><br>

  
endmodule

</code> <br><br>

<li>Within the main module (`DE0_NANO.v`), we instantiated this module and connected it to all the relevant wires. </li><br>

<li>We then created a register memory block that would store all the colors for the grid, with indices corresponding to the `GRID_X` and `GRID_Y` outputs of `GRID_SELECTOR`. Below is the code for the memory array:</li><br>

<code>
reg[7:0] grid4[2:0] [2:0];<br><br>

always @(*) begin<br>
  <ul>grid[0][0] = 8'd50;<br>
  grid[1][0] = 8'd100;<br>
  grid[0][1] = 8'd150;<br>
  grid[1][1] = 8'd200;<br>
  grid[2][0] = 8'd0;<br>
  grid[2][1] = 8'd0;<br>
  grid[2][2] = 8'd0;<br>
  grid[0][2] = 8'd0;<br>
  grid[1][2] = 8'd0;</ul>
end
</code><br><br>

<li> Finally, in order to assign the pixel color value, we perform the following assignment: `assign PIXEL_COLOR = grid[GRID_X][GRID_Y]`. </li><br>

<li> <h5 class = 'text-left' >Part 3: Rudimentary Arduino-FPGA Interface</h5></li><br>

<li>For the final component of the graphics portion of the lab, we were tasked with demonstrating that we can use an Arduino to communicate with the FPGA in order to display a certain graphic.  </li><br>

<li>We wrote an Arduino script that repeatedly counts to 3 in binary, with a 1/2 second delay between each iteration:</li><br>

<code>
int delayTime = 500; //ms; <br><br>

void setup() {<br>

  <ul>pinMode(8, OUTPUT);<br>
  pinMode(9, OUTPUT);</ul>
}<br><br>

void loop() {<br>
  <Ul>for (int i = 0; i<4; i++){ <br>
    <ul>if (i==0){ <br>
      <ul>digitalWrite(9, LOW);<br>
      digitalWrite(8, LOW);</ul>
    }<br>
    else if (i==1){<br>
      <ul>digitalWrite(9, LOW);<br>
      digitalWrite(8, HIGH);</ul>
    }<br>
    else if (i==2){<br>
      <ul>digitalWrite(9, HIGH);<br>
      digitalWrite(8, LOW);</ul>
    }<br>
    else{<br>
      <ul>digitalWrite(9, HIGH);<br>
      digitalWrite(8, HIGH);</ul>
    }<br>
    delay(delayTime);</ul>
  }</ul>

}
</code><br><br>

<li>The 2 bit Arduino output "data" then had to be transmitted to the FPGA. Since the Arduino outputs at 5v and the FPGA handles 3.3v, we implemented a simple voltage divider to pull down the voltage. We've included a circuit schematic:</li><br>
<img class="img-fluid img-centered" src="./resources/fgpa_arduino_schem.png" alt=""> <br>



<li>Notice that the voltage that is inputted to the FPGA is equal to the Arduino output pin voltage multiplied by 17.7/(17.7+9.89) =  0.64. When the Arduino voltage equals 5v (`HIGH`), then the voltage inputted to the FPGA (ports 33 and 31) equals roughly 3.2v, which is a permittable value for the FPGA. </li><br>

<li>The goal was to have each distinct binary valued input correspond to a distinct grid to be outputted to the display. The display should, therefore, change grid layouts every 1/2 second. </li><br>

<li>We made minor modifications to the code we previously had in order to allow for these changes. </li><br>

<li>Firstly, we instatiated 4 new memory arrays, corresponding to the 4 different kinds of grids that would be displayed.</li><br>

<code>
reg[7:0] grid1[2:0] [2:0];<br><br>

   grid4[1][2] = 8'd0;</ul>
end<br>
</code><br>

<li>Next, we added an `always` block that would set the `PIXEL_COLOR` depending on the value of the pins `GPIO_0_D[33]` and `GPIO_0_D[31]` (i.e. the output from the Arduino). Note that for this part, we instantiated the `GRID_SELECTOR` module in order to compute the grid coordinate (`GRID_X` and `GRID_Y`) that the pixel coordinate corresponds to. </li><br>

<code>
always @(*) begin<br>
  <ul>if (GPIO_0_D[33]==1'd0 && GPIO_0_D[31] == 1'd0) begin<br>
    <ul>PIXEL_COLOR = grid1[GRID_X][GRID_Y];</ul>
  end<br>
  if (GPIO_0_D[33]==1'd0 && GPIO_0_D[31] == 1'd1) begin<br>
    <ul>PIXEL_COLOR = grid2[GRID_X][GRID_Y];</ul>
  end<br>
  if (GPIO_0_D[33]==1'd1 && GPIO_0_D[31] == 1'd0) begin<br>
    <ul>PIXEL_COLOR = grid3[GRID_X][GRID_Y];</ul>
  end<br>
  if (GPIO_0_D[33]==1'd1 && GPIO_0_D[31] == 1'd1) begin<br>
    <ul>PIXEL_COLOR = grid4[GRID_X][GRID_Y];</ul>
  end</ul>
end<br>
</code><br>

<li>We've included a video demonstration:</li><br>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bsqfBa_z_XE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>

<li> <h5 class= 'text-left' >Future Graphics Plans </h5> </li><br>

<li>Since our current implementation of the grid is just the bare bones that was asked for in lab 3, we also planned out how we would draw out a more complex grid that mapped where our robot was, what part of the maze was already traversed, what was still unexplored, etc. </li><br>

<li>In our folder of final code, we have implemented a state machine that controls the robots movement, so if the robot must move up, down, left, or right in the maze, its wheels are directed accordingly. The current state of the robot will be communicated from the arduino to the fpga, as well as information of whether or not there is a wall on the left, right, or in front of the robot. This information will only be sent once it enters a "At a Junction" state so that the FPGA won't constantly be getting new, unnecessary updates. </li><br>

<li>This will give the FPGA the necessary amount of information to draw the bot's movements in real time. Here is a representation of what we would want our final robot mapping to look like using the real RBG values from the pseudo-code: </li><br>
<img class="img-fluid img-centered" src="./resources/grid.png" alt=""> <br>


<li>Some pseudo-code for this implementation would roughly look like: </li><br>

<code>
unexplored = 8'b11111111; <br>
walls = 8'b0; <br>
explored = 8'b11110111;      //pink<br>
bot = 8'b11100011;           //magenta<br>
treasures = 8'b11011100;     //yellow<br><br>

robot_position  = 2'd20;   // this is the starting grid number <br><br>

  
//capture the past position before movement before updating<br>
//the new robot position by marking it explored. <br>
gridcolor[robot position] = explored;  <br><br>

if robot is moving up: <br>
   <ul>robot_Y -= 1;  </ul>
if robot is moving down: <br>
   <ul>robot_Y += 1; </ul>
if robot is moving left: <br>
   <ul>robot_X -= 1; </ul>
if robot is moving right: <br>
   <ul>robot_X += 1;</ul>

update grid to show new robot position; <br>
update grid to show previous robot position has been explored; <br>

<li> <h5 class = 'text-left'> Part 1: Generating a square wave </h5> </li>

<li>A square wave was the simplest wave to generate, since we only needed to toggle one GPIO output on and off at our desired frequency. In order to generate the correct frequency, we created a clock divider parameter that divides the system clock of 25 MHz by 440 Hz. This provides the number of cycles that the FPGA needs to wait before toggling the GPIO pin. We needed to divide the clock divider by an additional factor of 2, so the pin would toggle both on and off in the desired number of cycles. The following code creates a simple counter that will toggle the GPIO pin once it counts through the number of cycles provided by CLKDIVIDER_440.
</li><br>

<li> <h6 class = 'text-left' >Square wave generation:</h6> </li>
<code>
//localparam<br>
localparam CLKDIVIDER_440 = 25000000 / 440 / 2;<br><br>

//sound variables<br>

assign GPIO_0_D[1] = square_440;<br>

  <ul>if (counter == 0) begin<br>
    <ul>counter <= CLKDIVIDER_440 - 1; //reset the clock<br>
    square_440 <= ~square_440; //toggle the square pulse</ul>
  end<br>
  else begin<br>
    <ul>counter <= counter - 1;<br>
    square_440 <= square_440;</ul>
  end</ul>
end<br>
</code><br>

<li>Then, we attached the GPIO pin 1 to the oscilliscope and speakers to see and hear the square wave. </li><br>

<li> <h5 class = 'text-left' > Part 2: Generating a sine wave</h5></li>

<li>To generate a sine wave, we used our square wave code, but made it substantially more complex. First, we needed to have a way to store and read out a sine wave (as opposed to calculating the sine values in real time). We did this by creating a ROM module using a Verilog template. We then ported in a sin table (which we created in MATLAB). On every positive edge of the clock, the module finds the relevant entry in the sin table that corresponds to the inputted address value. </li>

<li> <h6 class = 'text-left' > 8-bit sine function with values 0-255</h6> </li>

<img class="img-fluid img-centered" src="./resources/lab3_8bitsin.png" alt=""> <br>

  always @ (posedge clk) begin<br>
    <ul>q <= sine[addr];</ul>
  end</ul>

endmodule<br>
</code><br>

<li>In main, we connect the module to the registers that we have created. We create a sine wave at a specific frequency using a rudimentary direct digital synthesis (DDS) method. We increment through the sine table everytime a counter decrements to zero. Since we use a 25 MHz clock, we need to go through the sine table 400 times to get an output frequency of 400 Hz. Moreover, the sine table is 256 entries long. Hence, our formula for our counter is Clock frequency/Desired Frequency/Number of entries in the table, or in this particular case, 25,000,000/400/256. </li><br>

<li>To convert the digital sine wave to an analog signal for the speakers we used a R2R Digital to Analog Converter. </li>
<img class="img-fluid img-centered" src="./resources/lab3_r2rdac.png" alt=""> <br>


<li>We connected the 8 bit output register of GPIO pins to pins 1-8 on the DAC. Then, the analog signal from pin 16 of the DAC was connected to our speakers. This produced a perfect sine wave, as one can observe in the below video.</li><br>

<li> <h5 class = 'text-left' > Part 3: Generating Three Tones</h5></li><br>

<li>To generate the three tone signal, we worked off of our sine production code above. This time, instead of just having one clock divider, we created three (one for each tone we wanted to play). We created a simple FSM to switch between frequencies. The only change we had to make to the code which accesses the ROM was to simply make the counter reset to different values depending on the state. The FSM switches between states once per second, creating a pleasant incrementing of tones. You can hear this in the video below.</li>

<li>Note that this program simply plays the three tones in a loop, starting immediately. It would be fairly simple to hook this up to an one bit input signal from the Arduino (as the VGA team did above).</li><br>

Radhika, Katherine and Evan </p>

<h5>Introduction </h5><br>
<p>For the radio subteam of this lab, our goal was to communicate information between two arduinos through radio communication using two transceivers. We wanted to send simulated maze data from one arduino, which was set up as the transmitter, to another arduino, which was setup as a reciever. We also wanted to observe the range of the radio communication with different power/speed settings and look how many packets were successfully transmitted. </p><br>

<h5> Materials Used </h5>
<ul class = list-unstyled> 
  <ul><li>2 Nordic nRF24L01+ transceivers</li>
      <li>2 Arduino Unos (one was shared with the other sub-team)</li>
      <li>2 USB A/B cables</li>
      <li>2 radio breakout boards with headers</li>
  <ul><br>

<h5> Getting Started with the RF24 Transceivers</h5><br>
<p>As directed in the lab, first, we downloaded the RF24 arduino library. Then, to begin with simple tests of the transceivers, we used the 'Getting Started' code that was provided to us in the lab as opposed to the example code that came with the arduino library. Before we could begin, we had to adjust the identifier numbers for our two pipes using the formula 2(3D + N) + X where D is the day of our lab, N is our team number, and X was 0 and 1 for each of our 2 radios. Our calculated values happened to be 2 and 3,  the same as the ones in the sample code, as shown below:</p><br>

<code>
// Radio pipe addresses for the 2 nodes to communicate.<br>
const uint64_t pipes[2] = { 0x0000000002LL, 0x0000000003LL };
</code> <br><br>
<p>We first tested the sample code that was provided to us. We set up one arduino to be the transmitter by typing 'T' into the serial monitor of that arduino. The other arduino automatically became a reciever. The sample code was written to sent the time at which the data was being sent to the reciever. If the data was successfully sent, the transmitter then waits on a confirmation from the reciever. If the data wasn't sent successfully, the code tries to send the data again in 1 second. The code has a 200ms timeout value, so if the receiver hasn't confirmed that it has recieved the data in 200 ms, the code prints out a corresponding statement. If the receiver does confirm before timeout, the calculated round-trip delay time is printed out.  This is reflected in the following code:</p> <br>

<code>
    unsigned long time = millis();<br>
    printf("Now sending %lu...",time);<br>
    bool ok = radio.write( &time, sizeof(unsigned long) );<br>
<br>
    if (ok)<br>
       <ul>printf("ok...");</ul> <br>
    else<br>
       <ul>printf("failed.\n\r");</ul><br>
<br>
    <ul>radio.startListening();</ul><br>
<br>
// Wait here until we get a response, or timeout (200ms)<br>
    unsigned long started_waiting_at = millis();<br>
    bool timeout = false;<br>
    while ( ! radio.available() && ! timeout )<br>
      <ul>if (millis() - started_waiting_at > 200 )</ul><br>
        <ul>timeout = true;</ul></ul><br>
<br>
    // Describe the results<br>
    if ( timeout )<br>
    {<br>
      <ul>printf("Failed, response timed out.\n\r");</ul><br>
    }<br>
    else<br>
    {<br>
      // Grab the response, compare, and send to debugging spew<br>
      <ul>unsigned long got_time;</ul><br>
      <ul>radio.read( &got_time, sizeof(unsigned long) );</ul><br>
<br>
      // Spew it<br>
      printf("Got response %lu, round-trip delay: %lu\n\r",got_time,millis()-got_time);<br>
    }<br>
<br>
    // Try again 1s later<br>
    delay(1000);<br>
  }
</code><br><br>

<p>We tried different ranges for sending and receiving data. We didn't see a major drop in successful transmissions until we were almost in 2 separate rooms, so we believe the range of the radio communication is more than enough for our applications.</p>

<p>In the next steps, we modified the data we were sending between arduinos to reflect simulated maze data.
</p>

<h5>Sending full maze coordinates and maze updates with wireless communication</h5><br>

<p>To send the full maze coordinates, we altered the code to send a 5x5 array of unsigned chars. When sending and receiving transmissions, the arduino needs to be told what size packet it will be sending or receiving, so the key is to explicitly state what the maze size was when reading and writing data. </p><br>

<h6> So for sending and receiving a 5x5 array: </h6> <br>

<code>
unsigned char maze[5][5];<br>
// different maze values were randomly assigned and sent <br>
<br>
//sending <br>
bool ok = radio.write( &maze, sizeof(unsigned char)*25);<br>
//receiving <br>
bool done = radio.read( &maze, sizeof(unsigned char)*25);
</code><br><br>

<p>We noticed that when we increased the packet size, more packets of information were being dropped or taking too long to transmit, so we also played around with higher data rates and power levels. This yielded less dropped packets of information that transmitted faster, but we tried to err on the side of less power consumption. </p><br>

<code>
// set the power<br>
// RF24_PA_MIN=-18dBm, RF24_PA_LOW=-12dBm, RF24_PA_MED=-6dBM, and RF24_PA_HIGH=0dBm.<br>
radio.setPALevel(RF24_PA_MED);<br>
//RF24_250KBPS for 250kbs, RF24_1MBPS for 1Mbps, or RF24_2MBPS for 2Mbps<br>
radio.setDataRate(RF24_2MBPS);
</code><br><br>

<p>Here is a video of one arduino sending the entire maze to another: </p><br>

    <source src="resources/maze.mp4"></source> 
</video>

<h6> For sending and receiving maze updates via individual coordinate points: </h6>
<p>When sending maze updates, one arduino sent a 1x3 array of unsigned chars--the first two chars being the maze coordinates, and the third being new information that corresponded with that data point. The second arduino had a 5x5 maze array initialized on it so that the correct coordinate could be updated to reflect the incoming information as it was received. </p><br>

<code>
//random coordinate and data values were assigned<br>
unsigned char updates[3]; <br>
updates[0] = x;<br>
updates[1] = y;<br>
updates[2] = data;<br>
<br>
//sending individual maze updates<br>
bool ok = radio.write( &updates, sizeof(unsigned char)*3);<br>
<br>
//receiving and updating internal memory of maze <br>
done = radio.read( &updates, sizeof(unsigned char)*3 );<br>
maze[updates[0]][updates[1]]=updates[2];<br>
</code><br>

</video><br>


<h5> Sending information from base station to FPGA </h5>

<p>For the final part of the lab, we had to create a system for sending maze information from the Arduino base station to the FPGA. Since the robot was not yet operational, and we had already demonstrated that we can communicate wirelessly between the Arduinos, we generated test robot coordinate data to simulate the robot traversing the maze. Since we were able to demonstrate communication between the Arduinos, and from the Arduino to the base station, it will be relatively straightforward to link all of these devices together. Note that we did not demonstrate the communication of treasure and wall data from the Arduino to the FPGA. We have established a preliminary protocol for transmitting this data, but have not yet demonstrated this in practice. </p><br>

<p>Here is the Arduino code we wrote for this component of the lab (each part will be explained)</p><br>

<code>
int delayTime = 500; //ms;<br>
int setupTime = 50; //ms;<br>
String inputSignals[32] = {<br>
                        <ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul>"00000", "01000", "10000", "11000",<br>

                        "00010",  "01010", "10010", "11010",<br>

void setup() {<br>
  <ul>Serial.begin(9600);<br>
  pinMode(7,OUTPUT);<br>
  pinMode(6,OUTPUT);<br>

<br>

    <ul>if (signalWord.charAt(i) == '0'){<br>

    }<br>
    else{<br>
      <ul>digitalWrite(7-i, HIGH);</ul>
    }</ul>
  }</ul>      
}
</code><br><br>

<p>As discussed, the maze coordinate are encoded in a 5 bit word. In the Arduino code, we hard coded all 20 maze coordinates that the robot could possibly reach. This can be seen when we instantiate the `inputSignals` array. </p> <br>

<p>Since the FPGA reads this word on the rising edge of a clock, we had to create a 1-bit psuedo-clock signal in Arduino that is sychronized to change when we are ready to read the data. This is done in the `sendWord` method. Pin 2 corresponds to our "clock". We write a `LOW` value to the clock pin, and then wait `setupTime` amount of milliseconds before proceeding to actually write the coordinates to pins 7-3. We wait `setupTime` milliseconds before flipping the clock to a `HIGH` signal. Our thinking was that there is some propagation delay in the circuit. 50 milliseconds is plenty of time for the signal to set up, and for the FPGA to sample the correct value. If we didn't clock our signal, then we would run into issues sampling the signal when it is transitioning between values. </p> <br>

<p>The `writeWord` method is relatively straightforwards. It simply iterates through the word string, and then writes the values to the appropriate pin.</p> <br> 

<p>The output pins corresponding to the coordinate data and clock (digital pins 7-2) were connected to a voltage divider array in order to be sent to the FPGA (to be discussed in next section).</p> <br>



<h4 class = 'text-center'> FPGA Team</h4>
<p class = 'text-center' >TJ, Frannie, Michael</p> <br>

<h5>Introduction</h5> <br>

<p>For our sub-team, the goal of this lab was to recieve packets of information from the Arduino, and then use this information to update the VGA monitor using the FPGA. In order to accomplish this, we first built off of our team's work from Lab 3.</p><br>

<h6> Materials used:</h6>
<ul> <li> FPGA DE0-Nano</li>
<li>VGA-FPGA adapter</li>
<li>VGA cable and monitor</li> </ul>

<h5> Drawing a 4x5 grid</h5> <br>

<p>Changing our grid size was a fairly simple process, but did require some troubleshooting. First we updated the line `reg[7:0] grid1[2:0] [2:0]` to `reg[7:0] grid1[3:0] [4:0]` in our main module. We then assigned a color to each register in grid1 to create a checkerboard pattern. </p><br>

<p>When we uploaded the code to the FPGA, the squares were too large to view the full grid.  Thus, we changed the always block in our `GridSelector` module to the following:</p><br>

<code>
always @ (*) begin<br>
  <ul>GRID_X = PIXEL_COORD_X / 96;<br>
  GRID_Y = PIXEL_COORD_Y / 96;<</ul>
end
</code><br><br>

<p>Instead of bitshifting by 7 bits (dividing by 128 as before), we decided to divide by 96, since the height of the monitor is 480 pixels. 480 pixels / 5 squares = 96 pixels / square.</p><br>

<p>The squares were now all visible, but the grid would only display 4x4. After reviewing our code for a while, we realized we hadn't updated the registers `GRID_X` and `GRID_Y` to hold enough bits. We changed both of these to 4 bit registers and the grid was now 4x5!</p><br>

<h5> Changing color based on location</h5>

<p>Next, we needed to be able to update the grid to show the current location of the robot, as well as visited locations. To do this, we needed to rework the code from last lab, which had 4 different maps stored in memory. Rather than have each possible map stored in memory, we decided to update the map dynamically.</p> <br>

<p>To accomplish this, we created the following state machine:</p> <br>

<code>
reg[7:0] grid1[3:0][4:0];<br>
reg[7:0] currentGrid;<br>
   <br>
//state machine <br>
always @(posedge CLOCK_25) begin<br>
  <ul>if (GRID_X > 3) begin //colors squares that aren't in the 4x5 grid black (unreachable)<br>
    <ul>PIXEL_COLOR <= black;</ul>
  end<br>
  else begin<br>
  <ul>currentGrid <= grid1[GRID_X][GRID_Y];<br>
    if (currentGrid == 0) begin //if no input, color current square white (unvisited)<br>
      <ul>PIXEL_COLOR <= white;</ul>
    end<br>
    if (currentGrid[0] == 1) begin //if LSB is 1, color current square pink (visited)<br>
      <ul>PIXEL_COLOR <= pink;</ul>
    end</ul>
  end</ul>
end
</code><br><br>

<p>We then created a quick test to determine whether our implementation could receive inputs over time, update the grid and remember previous locations.</p> <br>

<p>We created two registers to encode x and y locations, and used the one second timer to update x and y. Then the square in the grid at location (x,y) was assigned `8'b1` which corresponded to a visited square in our FSM.</p> <br>

<code>
reg[2:0] x;<br>
reg[2:0] y;<br>
<br>
if (led_counter == ONE_SEC) begin<br> 
  <ul>led_state   <= ~led_state;<br>
  led_counter <= 25'b0;<br>
  if (y==3'b100) begin // you're at the bottom of the grid<br>
    <ul>y<= 3'b0;<br>
    x<=x+3'b001;</ul>
  end<br>
  else begin<br>
    <ul>y <= y + 3'b1;</ul>
  end <br>
  grid1[x][y] <= 8'b1;</ul>
end
</code><br><br>

<h5> FPGA Communication with Arduino</h5><br>

<p>With our 'state machine' working properly, it was easy to quickly assign different states to a grid tile and have a record of visited tiles. Our last step was to get the two halves of our assignment working together. We coordinated with the Arduino half of the team to make a protocol for robot position. In this case, we used the simplest possible communication scheme: A 5 bit array, with the first 2 bits representing x position, and the latter 3 representing y position. </p><br>

<p>Our FPGA was hooked up directly to the Arduino by a set of 6 wires (5 data bits, one valid bit). This setup took a frustrating amount of time, because the DE0 Nano datasheet's pinout diagram for GPIO-1 is unintuitive (to put it lightly). Once our pins were indeed hooked up correctly (this took a lot of oscilloscope debugging on our part), we worked on properly interpreting messages from the Arduino.</p><br>

<p>We used an independent module for the reading of data from the Arduino, called inputReader:</p><br>

<code>
 module inputReader(<br>
valid,<br>
arduinoInput,<br>
robotX,<br>
robotY,<br>
preX,<br>
preY);<br>
<br>
input valid;<br>
input [4:0] arduinoInput;<br>
output reg [1:0] robotX;<br>
output reg [2:0] robotY;<br>
<br>
output reg [1:0] preX;<br>
output reg [2:0] preY;<br>
<br>
always @ (posedge valid) begin<br>
  <ul>preX = robotX;<br>
  preY = robotY;<br>
  robotX = arduinoInput[4:3];<br>
  robotY = arduinoInput[2:0];</ul>
end<br>
<br>
endmodule
</code><br><br>
 
<p>We initially struggled to get data to correctly update (our screen update schema was simple - put the robot on the tile the Arduino sent, record all past tiles sent as visited, and make the rest unvisited). We observed that in general, the tiles were flipping to visited in the order we expected, but not at a constant rate. Certain tiles would change colors two at a time. This signaled to us that the FPGA was not reading the data correctly. Because our inputReader module was reading data whenever the valid bit was high, the FPGA was capturing incorrect grid values that occurred when the output bits from the Arduino were flipping. We altered both the Arduino and the FPGA code, to capture Arduino data only on the pos edge of the valid bit, thereby preventing our error.</p><br>

<p>We were able to successfully communicate information wirelessly from one Arduino to another, then display it on a screen using the FPGA. See the below video:

                  <h2 class="text-center">Milestone 1</h2>
                  
<p>The goal of this milestone was to implement line following and program our robot to drive in a figure eight.</p>

<h4 class = 'text-left'> Hardware Modifications </h4> 

<p>We began by attaching the light sensors to the bottom of the robot. We used the line sensors provided, and began with three sensors. After seeing what other groups approached the problem with, we were uncertain of the viability of the three sensor design. However, having two sensors on either side of the line worked very well, because any time one went over the tape, we could immediately tell the robot was off course. In fact, we could likely remove the middle sensor and retain all functionality.</p>

<img class="img-fluid img-centered" src="./resources/sensorposition.png" alt=""> <br>


<p>We had some issues with getting consistent readings from the line sensors, so our first solution was to put the line sensors closer to the ground. We did this by switching out the wheels. This made our line readings significantly more consistent. The value of the middle sensor (reading the black tape) was typically over 900, while the outer sensors read between 100 and 300 on the white board.</p>

<p>We ran into significant hardware problems as we continued working on our project. When the robot was programmed to go straight, it would continuously veer to the left. This behavior suggests an improper servo calibration, but setting both servos to 90 resulted in no movement (so the servos must have been properly calibrated). We puzzled over this problem for several hours, switching out several servos and adjusting our code to unevenly power one servo more than the other. Probing the PWM signals at the Arduino output pins revealed that they were behaving as expected. Re-doing the wiring ended up fixing the problem. Likely, one signal connection was loose and sent an odd PWM signal to the servo.
</p>

alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="240" height="180" border="10" /></a>

<h4 class = 'text-left'> Software Implementation </h4>

<p>Our line detection algorithm was fairly simple. We observed that the sensors measured over 800 units on black tape and under 300 units (typically under 150) on the white board. We noted that if the robot moved off the tape in either direction, one of the outer sensors would be over black tape. We then could adjust wheel speeds and turn back onto the correct path. We could detect junctions when all three sensors were over the black tape.</p>

<p>Because we primarily tested later in the day, where light was lower, we set the black/white threshold at 400 units - this high margin ensured that we would not get any false positives - i.e., the robot would not shift unexpectedly. </p>

<p>Our line detection mechanism proved to be very robust. Whenever it was tested, it could accurately detect robot position relative to the line. 
</p>
<p>The primary challenge we faced was implementing the actual motion correction. We initially adjusted the speed of each servo by 1 to 2 units. We could not figure out why line correction was not working. The serial output told us that the robot was detecting position correctly, and that it was in fact changing the PWM signal. We hypothesized that it was in fact a servo issue - and while there was a servo hardware problem (see above) - this was not the primary issue. After several hours of testing, we finally pushed the correction servo power up significantly. One servo would move fowards at +45 (relative to 90) and the other would move at -45 (relative to 90). This gave us immediate and real results. We successfully implemented line correction!</p>

<code>
  if(line[2]>400){<br>
    <ul>rightSpeed = 45;<br>
    Serial.println("LEFT");<br>
    leftSpeed = 180 ;</ul>
  }<br>
  else if(line[0]>400){<br>
    <ul>leftSpeed =135;<br>
    rightSpeed = 0;<br>
    Serial.println("RIGHT");</ul>
  }<br>
  else if (line[0]<400 && line[2]<400){<br>
    <ul>Serial.println("STRAIGHT");<br>
    leftSpeed = 135;<br>
    rightSpeed = 45;</ul>
  }<br>
</code><br>

<p>To get the robot to turn at a junction, we specified the conditions under which the robot should continue to turn. We set the servos' speed to turn once the sensors detect a junction. Most of our code directs the robot based on whether the sensors detect that the robot is at a junction, on the line, to the left of line, or to the right of the line, but turning must be address differently. For example, as the robot turns left, the sensors (which are all currently located at the front of the bot) will first report that the robot is on the line, then left of the line, then for a period of time it will not be able to detect the line at all, then right of the line, and finally back on the line. </p>

<p>Thus, we implemented code that broke from the primary loop that directs the robot based on position in reference to the line, allowing the robot to continue to turn after it turns away from the junction. Since the robot begins and ends a turn directly on the line, one of two boolean requirements must be satisified in order for the robot to continue to turn: it must either have not passed the line it originally began on, or the robot isn't straight on the line yet. This is roughly implemented as shown below: </p>

<code>
  boolean straight = (line[0]<400 && line[1]>400 && line[2]<400);<br>
  boolean passed = false; <br>
  <br>
  if (leftWheel == leftTurn | leftWheel == rightTurn){<br>
    <ul>if {!straight | !passed) {<br>
      <ul>if (line[1]<400) { <br>
        <ul>passed = true; </ul> 
      }<br>
      break; </ul>
    }<br>
    passed = false; </ul>
  }<br>
</code><br>

<h5 class='text-left'>Analog circuit</h5>

<p>We constructed an analog circuit and wrote Arduino code that detects specific frequencies. </p>

<p>The first stage of implementation was creating an analog circuit that would feed time-domain voltage data to the Arduino Uno. The raw voltage output from the phototransistor upon receiving incident IR radiation has a significant DC component and a relatively small voltage swing. Our goal was to have the Arduino recieve a voltage input between 0 and 5 volts, with large voltage swing. Simply feeding the phototransistor voltage through a noninverting amplifier would amplify the DC component, and render the output signal unusable. Thus, we had to essentially create a high-pass filter at the op-amp input, and then add a DC bias signal to the op-amp output to ensure that the voltage stays within the 0-5v range. We achieved this by constructing the following circuit:</p>

<img class="img-fluid img-centered" src="./resources/milestone2ircircuit.png" alt=""> <br>


<p>C1 and R2 function as a high-filter to remove the input DC. The 2.5V DC source before R2 is intended to DC-bias the output votlage so that the Arduino can properly read the signal. The theoretical gain of the circuit is roughly 5.5K (1 + R3/R4), though the demonstrated gain is much lower. Note that the actual circuit embedded on the robot will use a voltage divider to implement the 2.5V DC source, not an actual DC voltage source.</p> 

<h5 class = 'text=left'> Arduino code</h5>

<p>When developing the Arduino code to detect frequencies, we wanted to ensure that we had robust code that can detect variable frequencies. We also wanted to reduce false-positive and false-negatives.</p> 

<p>The code we developed first generates an array containing the amplitudes of the time-domain signal at frequencies related to the bin index. Afterwards, we call 3 functions that check to see if the given array encodes a 7 kHz, 12 kHz, or 17 kHz signal. Each of the functions for each frequency first computes the "expected bin" where the highest ampitude should be observed. The theory is that if a signal is indeed a 7 kHz, 12 kHz, or 17 kHz signal, then the FFT should have a peak at those frequencies. However, given the imprecision of treasure frequency, combined with the nonlinearities of the circuit, there could be small discrepancies in where the max peak for a given periodic is observed versus where it should be. To address this issue, the function, `detectedFrequency` finds the maximum value within a predefined `peakIndexWidth` of the expected peak. From inspecting the graphs of different signals, we deduced that the maximum amplitude always falls within ~5 bins of where it is expected to be (so the default value for `peakIndexWidth` equals 5). The function iterates through all the FFT values in the array that are within `peakIndexWidth` from the expected max bin. It finds the maximum value contained in this window of bins. The function then checks to see if this maximum value exceeds an absolute threshold, in order to ensure that random noise signals don't produce false positives. If the maximum value fails to exceed an absolute threshold, the function returns `false`, indicating that input signal does not encode a specific frequency. Next, the function checks to see if there are no other bins which contain a value as high as the computed maximum value in the bin window. We don't count bins less than 30, since these correspond to strong DC signals, which are always contained in the input. If the function finds other bins that have values which exceed the value around the expected peak, then the function returns `false`, indicating that the signal is not a periodid signal with the specified frequency. If the input FFT array passes all these checks, then we determine that the signal is a periodic signal of the specified frequency and return `true`. A `true` return value prompts the program to print the frequency value that it has detected. </p>

<p>There's a lot of boilerplate code from the FFT libtary. The function we implemented was `detectedFrequency`. We also added the `if` statements at the end of the `loop` method. </p>

<h4 class='text-left'>Distance Sensing</h4>

<p>Materials used:</p>
<ul class = 'text-unstyled'> <ul>
  <li> breadboard </li>
<li>wires</li>
<li>long distance sensor</li>
<li>short distance sensor</li>
<li>Arduino Uno</li><li> USB serial cable</li> </ul></ul>

<p>For this milestone, we implemented distance sensing.  We had two sensor options:  long range and short range.  
We at first decided that we wanted to try to use a combination of both sensors, as the short range would detect 
walls up close and tell the robot to turn to avoid collision, and the long range would allow for faster mapping.  </p>
 
<p>We tested the short range sensor first.  We wired up a simple circuit consisting of the distance sensor and the
Arduino and wrote simple code to display the values outputted from the distance sensor when the block of wood 
was located at different distances away.  We recorded data for the short range sensor when the block of wood was 
located in 5 cm intervals from 5 cm to 35 cm away, within the range of the specifications of the sensor we found 
online.  We found that the specifications for the short range sensor online were consistent with the data we 
recorded, a graph of which is shown below.</p>
<img class="img-fluid img-centered" src="./resources/Screen Shot 2017-09-23 at 3.56.28 PM.png" alt=""> <br>

 
<p>realized that the sensors were transmitting a signal in a wide cone and were therefore detecting objects around 
the room that were not relevant.  This is the data we got from two subsequent trials for the long range sensors.</p>

<p>We decided that because the long range sensors were more unpredictable, and because we thought the short range 
sensors would be able to more accurately predict when the robot was approaching a wall, we would implement
wall detection using short range sensors. </p>
<p>Our code for this is shown below: 
 </p>
<code>
    if (distanceValue > 100) {<br>
      <ul>wall = true;<br>
      servoL.write(90);<br>
      servoR.write(90);<br>
      delay(500);</ul>
    }    <br>
<code><br>
<p>Here is a brief video of the robot with the integrated distance sensor. As it approaches the wall, it turns at the closest junction. </p>

<li>Optical team realizes they have not made the modifications necessary to make the Arduino light an LED in response to incident IR light, so we discuss when we can meet to work on that objective.
The robotics team explains that our robot is able to stop at junctions with extreme accuracy, but it is having trouble following a line.  We figure the reason the robot is having this trouble is because the servos that run the two wheels are not operating at the same speed.  The robotics team adds that the robot is having trouble moving forward in a straight line even when it is not attempting to follow a line, which further confirms our hypothesis. </li>

                  <h2 class="text-center">TEAM CONTRACT</h2>
                    <ul class = "list-unstyled"> 
                      <li> <p class="text-center">ECE 3400, Semester #FA17 Team #1</p> </li>
<li> <p class="text-center">Team Members: Radhika Chinni, Frances Koback, TJ Hurd, Katherine Lu, Michael  Solomentsev, Evan Kravitz</p> </li>

<li> <h3 class="text-left">Team Procedures</h3> </li>
<ul>
  <li>We will plan to meet every Friday at 11:15 in the lobby of the 3rd floor of Upson Hall.  If we decide additional meetings are necessary, we will decide the date and time of the next meeting at the end of the previous meeting. If there is a lecture scheduled on Friday so that we can’t have a full-length meeting, we will discuss what works for that week during or after our lab session on Monday in Phillips 427 depending on how busy we are. </li>
  <li>The team leader will set each agenda for all meetings in the period to which he or she has been assigned the team leader position.  Put the agenda in our Google Drive folder. The team leader will send a reminder message of the location and time of the next meeting the day prior in our GroupMe. The team leader will also be responsible for making sure the agenda for each meeting has been followed and that all assignments in that time period are turned in on time.  The team leader will have it under his or her discretion to decide how to respond when the rest of the team is not following the agenda, but should definitely open an honest discussion about any slack during a weekly meeting. </li>
  <li>This team will make all decisions by majority vote. If someone is particularly knowledgeable for one part of our project, we will take their opinion into extra consideration.</li>
  <li>Meeting minutes will be taking for all group meetings, partial or full. Minutes will by default be taken by the team leader next in succession (i.e. the individual who will lead the team during the next time period). Minutes should be added to website within a few days of a meeting. </li>
  <li>All members can communicate with the larger group through GroupMe. Everyone is responsible for responding within the course of a day through appropriate messaging, gif response, or heart emoji. </li>
  <li>Any changes to this contract require a majority vote by team members.</li>
</ul>
<li> <h3 class = "text-left">Team Expectations</h3>
  <ul>
<li> <h4 class ="text-left">Work Quality:</h4> </li>
  <ul>
    <li>We agree to always peer review our work on the website and strive to create the best website we possibly can. </li> 
    <li>Individuals /sub-teams must finish their part at least a day before the deadline, foregoing extraneous circumstances.  If any individual or subteam in charge of a certain part of the project feels overwhelmed and does not think that the portion to which the team or individual is assigned can be completed in this time frame, said individual or subteam will inform the rest of the group and the group will arrange to compensate to help get the project completed.  </li>
  </ul>
<li> <h4 class ="text-left">Strategies to fulfill these standards:</h4> </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Team Participation:</li>
      <ul>

          </ul>
        <li>Strategies for keeping on task (task maintenance):</li>
          <ul>
              <li>We will be trying our best to hold ourselves accountable on a mobile app called Trello which serves as a virtual to-do list which tracks the progress of each task. Anyone can add an action point or mark an action point as in progress of completed. It has a pretty user-friendly GUI interface so we probably won’t write up a tutorial for it but we can if further inquiry arises. </li>
          </ul>
        <li>Strategies to get help if you're stuck:</li>
          <ul>
              <li>Ask for team help in GroupMe.</li>
              <li>Ask a T.A. </li>

          </ul>
        <li>Expected level of responsibility for fulfilling team assignments, timelines, and deadlines:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Each member is required to fulfill their responsibilities as they were delegated by the team lead. Subteam members should aid each other in meeting deadlines appropriately.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Expected level of communication with other team members:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Each member is responsible for communicating with all other team members when they have a high work load and/or are struggling with their task. We expect team members to freely reach out to each other.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Expected level of commitment to team decisions and tasks: </li>
          <ul>
            <li>If a majority vote has been reached, even dissenting members are responsible for seeing through the majority decision. </li>
          </ul>
        <li>How should a team member catch up if they have to miss a meeting: </li>
          <ul>
            <li>Reach out to the team leader and get assigned a task to do to make up for missed work. </li>

            <li>At the next meeting, group will address the issue with the person who committed the infraction.  Based on how that individual responds to this confrontation the group will determine the best course of action moving forward.  </li>
          </ul>
        <li>Describe what your team will do if these infractions continue:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>After repeated infractions, the rest of the team will collectively decide a plan of action (either speaking to course staff or reaching out to said individual).</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
  </ul>
